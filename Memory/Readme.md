### What is Memory? 

Memory is a electronic holding place for instruction and data that a CPU needs to reach quickly. Memory is used by computer operating system , hardware and software(Basically everything). There are two types of memory Primary memory and Secondary memory.  We should not confuse memory with storage.

### Difference between Memory and Storage

Memory is the primary memory and Storage is secondary memory. 

RAM (Random access memory) is a primary memory. Memory is also a place where information is processed. It enables user to access data that will be available for a shorter period. RAM or Primary memory is physically placed very closer to the processing unit so it is faster to retrive and store data. This memory is volatile meaning the content stored here cannot be retained once we turn off the power supply. 

The term storage refers to secondary memory where the data in a computer is kept. Example of a computer storage is hard drive or hard disk drive (HDD). Storage is non-volatile meaning the information is kept safe even after the power supply is turned off. 

The information and files required by a program that is running is kept in the memory and stored in storage after it is closed.

### Why RAM is lesser than ROM in computers and devices ? 

In general a computer will have higher ROM than RAM. For Example, A computer can have 8Gb RAM and 250Gb ROM. The difference in space is because the computer won't need all the files immediately to access. So allocating 8Gb or 16Gb is enough for a computer to run programs seamlessly. Cost is also an important factor for lesser RAM .
